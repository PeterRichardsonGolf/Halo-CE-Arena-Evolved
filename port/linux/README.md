# Linux

`ninja linux` compiles the game with clang for 32-bit x86 Linux. The result
is a native executable, `build/linux/halo`. The game shows its graphics with
OpenGL 4.5. It plays sound through SDL3. It accepts keyboard, mouse and
gamepad input.

The game is 32-bit code because its data (tags, cache files, saved games)
contains 32-bit pointers, as on the Xbox.

## Requirements

You do not need the Xbox SDK. The declarations that the game uses are in
`port/include/xdk`.

To build:

- Python and ninja.
- clang. The option `--linux-cc` of `configure.py` selects a different
  compiler.
- The 32-bit glibc development files: `lib32-glibc` on Arch Linux,
  `gcc-multilib` and `libc6-dev-i386` on Debian and Ubuntu.
- The 32-bit SDL3: `lib32-sdl3` on Arch Linux, `libsdl3-dev:i386` on Debian
  and Ubuntu.

To start the game:

- The 32-bit OpenGL libraries (`lib32-mesa`).
- The 32-bit PipeWire or PulseAudio client libraries (`lib32-pipewire` or
  `lib32-libpulse`).

## Build the game

1. Go to the root folder of the repository.
2. Enter `python configure.py`.
3. Enter `ninja linux`.

### 64-bit

`ninja linux64` builds the same game as native x86-64 code,
`build/linux64/halo`, the way the macOS build does (the 64-bit build in
[port/macos/README.md](../macos/README.md): `HALO_64BIT` and the `long`
rewrite, `tools/lp64_build.py`). It needs the 64-bit glibc and SDL3
development files (`sdl3` on Arch Linux, `libsdl3-dev` on Debian 13 and
Ubuntu 25.04 or later) instead of the 32-bit ones, and the 64-bit OpenGL and
sound libraries to start. An SDL3 built by hand is found through
`LIBRARY_PATH` when linking and `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` when starting. It is not
optimised with a profile (the committed profiles are the 32-bit build's).
Its releases are their own download, `arena-evolved-linux64-release.zip`.
It plays Halo PC's Custom Edition maps
(`maps/ce/`) and plays with the 32-bit builds and the other ports over the
network, and it is a dedicated server too (`server/README.md`).

## Start the game

Enter `build/linux/halo`.

The game data is the folder that contains `maps/`, from an Xbox disc image
of any version of the game. The game looks for this folder in this
sequence:

1. `paths.data` in `config.toml`.
2. The current folder.
3. The folder of the executable.
4. `assets/` in the current folder, and `assets/` in the repository that
   contains the executable.

If the game finds no data, it asks for an Xbox disc image (`.xiso` or
`.iso`). This occurs at the first start:

- Select "No" to stop the game.
- Select "Yes" to open a file picker. Select the disc image. The game copies
  `maps/` next to the executable and shows the progress.

The game writes the copy to `maps.partial`. When the copy is complete, the
game changes the name to `maps`. If the copy stops before it is complete,
the game asks for the disc image again at the next start.

## Files and folders

| Xbox drive | Folder |
| --- | --- |
| `d:\` | The data root: the folder that contains `maps/`. |
| `z:\` | `z/` in the save root. This folder contains the cache (approximately 800 MB of map data) and the saved games. |
| `u:\` | `u/` in the save root. This folder contains the user data. |

The save root is `paths.saves` in `config.toml`. If that setting is empty,
the save root is `$XDG_DATA_HOME/halo-linux` (usually
`~/.local/share/halo-linux`).

The game makes the folders when it needs them. Names of files and folders
are not case-sensitive, as on the Xbox.

These files are in the data root:

| File | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| `debug.txt` | The log of the game. At start-up, the game shows the data root in the terminal. A crash writes its report (the faulting address and the calls that led to it) here as well; the `reference address` line at the top of each session places those addresses in the build. |
| `init.txt` | Console commands that the game does at start-up. For example, `map_name levels\a10\a10` starts the first campaign level. |

Voice packs for the spoken callouts (item and clock timers) are folders of
WAVs in `voices/<pack>/` in the data root (`one.wav` ... `ten.wav`,
`one_minute.wav` ... `thirty_minutes.wav`, `rockets.wav`, `beep.wav` and so
on, with a `manifest.json`). A pack may also have `beep_minute.wav`,
`beep_tick.wav` and `beep_item.wav` (else `beep.wav` is used),
`rockets_in_ten.wav` and the like for the 10-second calls (else the name),
`red_rockets.wav` / `blue_rockets.wav` (and `red_sniper`, `blue_overshield`
and so on) for the 10-second call of an item a map has at both bases, when the pack
has both sides' (else the call above, said once for both),
and `rockets_up.wav`, `sniper_up.wav`, `overshield_up.wav`, `camo_up.wav`
said at the spawn (else nothing). Items spawning together use
`overshield_camo_in_ten.wav` / `overshield_camo_up.wav` (an overshield and
a camo), and three or more the line of their kinds:
`power_weapons_in_ten.wav` / `_up`, `power_items_in_ten.wav` / `_up` (the
powerups) or `weapons_and_power_items_in_ten.wav` / `_up` (else
`weapons_and_powerups_*`, else `powerups_in_ten.wav` and each item's "is
up"); a spawn point of overshield or camo at random
`overshield_or_camo_in_ten.wav`, and `powerup_up.wav` when its item is not
seen; CALLOUT DETAIL's VERBOSE lists use `and.wav` and `in_ten.wav`; each
when the pack has them (else the separate calls). `python tools/import_nhe_voice.py
<mods/NHE/maps> <data root>/voices/nhe` makes the `nhe` pack from Halo 1:
NHE's voice timer clips. The clips come from the player's own NHE map files
and are not distributed with the game; the tool does not write inside the
repository (except under `build/`). CALLOUTS (`game.callouts`) says them in
the voice `game.callout_voice` names.

The settings are in `config.toml` next to the executable. Refer to
"Settings". Internet play's MQTT brokers are in `brokers.txt` next to it
(`network.brokers_file`).

If the game stops because of a fatal signal, it writes the address and a
backtrace to the standard error. To find the function at the address, enter
`addr2line -e build/linux/halo <address>`.

## Controls

The keyboard and the mouse are a control scheme of their own for the player
of controller 1: each action has up to two keys or mouse buttons, which
Settings > Controls Setup (or `[controls]` in `config.toml`) changes. The
game adds the input of the first gamepad to controller 1. The other
gamepads operate controllers 2 to 4. With two or more players on this
computer (co-op, or split screen in a network game) and only one gamepad,
that gamepad is controller 2 (player 2) and the keyboard and mouse stay
controller 1. The gamepad changes controller only when none of its buttons
is held. The profile's button layout (Settings > Gamepads) is the
gamepads' only.

| Action | Keys and buttons (default) |
| --- | --- |
| move | W, A, S, D |
| aim | mouse (direct aim) |
| fire | left mouse button |
| throw a grenade | right mouse button, G |
| jump (and skip a cutscene) | space |
| crouch | left ctrl, C |
| melee | F, mouse button 4 |
| reload | R |
| action (pick up, hold to swap weapons, enter or leave a vehicle; never reloads) | E |
| change the weapon | mouse wheel, 1 |
| change the grenade | X |
| flashlight | Q |
| zoom | Z, middle mouse button |
| show the scores (hold) | tab |
| pause menu | escape |

Always: \` opens the developer console, F12 releases or captures the mouse,
F11 changes between fullscreen and window, F9 takes a screenshot and F10
starts or stops a recording (refer to "Screenshots and recordings").

One movement of the mouse wheel changes the weapon one time. A second
movement after a short pause changes it again.

In the menus, the mouse moves a pointer:

- The item below the pointer gets the focus.
- A left click selects the item. On a setting with values, a click on the
  left or right half changes the value. On a button in the key of a screen
  (for example "B = Back"), a click pushes that button.
- On the on-screen keyboard (a profile's name), a left click presses the
  key below the pointer, or pushes the "B =BACK" or "A =ENTER" legend.
- A right click goes back.
- The mouse wheel moves through the items.

The keyboard also operates the menus, with keys of its own: the arrow keys
(and W, A, S, D) move, space or enter selects, escape or backspace goes
back (escape resumes the game from the pause menu), delete deletes. When the game continues, the mouse aims again. A mouse button that you hold from the menu does not fire until
you push it again.

## Screenshots and recordings

F9 saves the game's picture (every split-screen view, the HUD and the game's
menus) as a PNG file in `screenshots/` next to `config.toml`, named by the
date, the time and the map (`2026-10-07_21-05-12_bloodgulch.png`; a second
one in the same second gets `_2`, and so on to `_99`). "SCREENSHOT SAVED"
shows at the top right for a moment. The overlay screens that are drawn
over the window and not by the game (the game list's) are not in it.

F10 starts a recording and F10 again stops it: a video with the game's
sound, `recordings/<date>_<time>_<map>.mp4` next to `config.toml`
(`capture.record_directory`). A red dot shows at the top right while
recording (`capture.record_indicator`); the dot is never in the video.
Recordings need [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org), which the game does not ship:
put `ffmpeg` (`ffmpeg.exe` on Windows) next to the game or on the `PATH`,
or set `capture.ffmpeg_path` (its path, or a name to look for on the
`PATH`). Without it, F10 shows "RECORDING NEEDS FFMPEG" and does nothing
else. On Windows, ffmpeg runs without a window of its own.

- The video has a fixed frame rate (`capture.record_fps`, 60 or 30) and
  plays at the real speed: a frame that the game draws slower than that
  is repeated, and frames that it draws faster are left out.
- The picture is the game's own resolution: the window's, 640x480 with
  `display.resolution_scaling = "original"`, and larger than the window
  with supersampling (a 1080p window gives a 4K video, four times the
  data). The frames on their way to ffmpeg have a memory budget (160 MB,
  48 MB in the 32-bit builds): a picture too large for it is not recorded
  ("RECORDING TOO LARGE").
- The video keeps the size the picture had when the recording started. If
  the window grows during a recording, the video shows the middle of the
  picture; if it shrinks, the picture is in the middle of the video, on
  black.
- The video is H.264 (`capture.record_quality`: CRF 28, 23 or 18) and the
  sound AAC, from what you hear (after the volumes). The game writes the
  picture and the sound into two files beside the video while it records,
  and puts them together when the recording stops ("RECORDING SAVED").
- The game never waits for ffmpeg: if ffmpeg falls behind, frames are left
  out (the log counts them), and the video keeps to real time. If ffmpeg
  fails or stops, the recording stops at once ("RECORDING FAILED"); an
  ffmpeg that takes no frame for 10 seconds is stopped.
- When the game closes during a recording, it saves the recording first
  (the log says so), for up to 30 seconds in all. A recording that is not
  saved by then is lost: the game stops its ffmpeg and removes its files,
  and keeps no video without its sound. Files that are still being written have names that
  end in `.part`; the game removes any that an earlier session left (10
  minutes old or more) when it starts.

`debug.record_seconds` (`HALO_RECORD_SECONDS`) records that many seconds
from the first frame of play (a map other than the main menu's), for tests.

## Menus

The menus are the PC version's (Halo Custom Edition's): its main menu and
every screen it leads to (campaign, profiles, multiplayer with its server
browser, direct IP and server setup, the gametype editor, and the profile's
settings: controls, gamepads, mouse, audio, video, network and colour),
laid out as it has them. Their pictures are the high-res redraws; the few
that are not yet (3D renders, screenshots) are drawn from the Xbox's own
menus where it has the same, else a placeholder, listed in
`port/assets/menus/NON_HANDDRAWN.md`.

The campaign is wired: Campaign, on player 1's profile (the one last used),
continues its saved game, starts a level it has reached at a difficulty (New
Game), or loads or deletes any profile's saved game (Load Game). Many of the
other functions behind the screens are not wired to this game yet
(`port/assets/menus/UNWIRED.md`): the lists they fill (profiles, maps,
servers, key bindings) are empty, and the settings they change do not
change. The screens open, close and move between each other as the PC
version's. Arena Evolved starts on these PC menus (`display.menus = "pc"`), which
hold its settings; `display.menus = "xbox"` gives the Xbox's menus, which start
every kind of game and have Online Games (ChupathingyCE's default).

Multiplayer > CO-OP CAMPAIGN is the Xbox's cooperative play, which the PC
version does not have: two players on this computer play the campaign in
split screen. Player 1 is the player who chose it, on the current profile.
Player 2 then chooses a profile with their own controller (a gamepad), and
New Game's levels are those either profile has reached. Either player's
controller chooses the level and the difficulty. A co-op game does
not continue a saved game of one player.

Network games have split screen too: up to 4 players on each computer. In
the game lobby, another controller presses START to join, and the new
player's profile is chosen on the ADD PLAYER screen that opens (with any
controller). With one gamepad, choose the lobby's ADD PLAYER button first:
until then that gamepad shares controller 1 with the keyboard. Two players on one profile get different names from the host. A
player's B in the lobby leaves the game alone, and the last player of the
computer leaves it for all of them. In the game, each player's pause menu
opens on their part of the screen, and its LEAVE GAME is theirs: their part
of the screen stays until the game ends. A game under way shows its own
screen before JOIN GAME: players join there the same way, START or ADD
PLAYER then START, and JOIN GAME brings them all into the game.

In a multiplayer game, the pause menu (escape) has SETTINGS, which opens
the profile's settings while the game goes on, and for the host END GAME.
END GAME ends the game as its time limit does: the players stay, and after
the carnage report the host picks the next map and gametype (PICK GAME).
LEAVE GAME of the host still ends the game for everyone. The buttons go into
the map's own pause menu, before LEAVE GAME, so the buttons of a custom map
stay. The Xbox's pause box is drawn taller to hold them (a redraw,
`port/assets/menus/port_svg/pause`); a custom map's box keeps its size, and
what is below its list moves down. The few pictures of the settings that
come from the main menu's map are not drawn there.

The menus are XML files in `port/assets/menus` (`tools/ce_menus.py` writes
them from the PC version's tags), which the game contains. To change them,
put files in a `menus` folder next to `config.toml`: a file with the same
path replaces one of the game's, and another `.xml` file is added.
`port/assets/menus/README.md` describes the files. If a file has a problem,
the game uses the Xbox's menus and the log names the file, the line and the
problem.

## Settings

The settings are in `config.toml` next to the executable
(`build/linux/config.toml`). At the first start, the game writes the file
with a comment for each setting and its default value, commented out:

```toml
# The menus: "pc" (the default) for the PC version's main menu
# ...
# menus = "pc"
```

A setting that is commented out follows the default of the version that
runs, so a new version with a different default changes it. To choose a
value, remove the `# ` at the start of the line and change the value. Only
the settings that you (or the Settings menu) change are lines without `#`;
those stay as they are, also if a later version changes the default. To get
the default values again, delete the file.

The game reads the file at start-up. If a key is not correct, or a value
has the wrong type, the game writes the line to the log and uses the default
value. The Settings menu (Video, Mouse, Audio, Network and Controls Setup)
changes the useful settings, writes them into the file (only their lines
change: the line of a setting at its default loses its `#`) and applies
them at once, but `audio.enabled`, and `display.menus` from the next main
menu. A new version adds its new settings to the file, commented out.

Earlier versions wrote every setting as a value. The first start of this
version updates such a file once (`config_version = 2` at the top
marks it): a setting that holds the default of this version, or the
default of an earlier version (`display.menus = "pc"`, the default before
ChupathingyCE 0.5.2b, or `"xbox"`, its default since), is commented out, so that it follows the default. A setting with
another value stays. The log has one line that tells what changed.

Each setting has an environment variable. The environment variable changes
the setting for one start of the game. It has priority over the file.

| Setting | Default | Environment variable | Function |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `display.mode` | `""` | `HALO_DISPLAY_MODE` | `"fullscreen"`: the display, taken at the mode of `display.resolution` (the nearest the display has), or at its desktop mode. `"borderless"`: a window over the whole desktop, whose mode does not change. `"windowed"`: a window of `display.window_size`. Empty: `display.fullscreen` decides (`true`: borderless). F11 changes between the window and the fullscreen mode. Video Setup sets it. |
| `display.fullscreen` | `true` | `HALO_FULLSCREEN` | `true`: borderless, as `display.mode = "borderless"`. `false`: a window, as `display.mode = "windowed"`. Used when `display.mode` is empty. |
| `display.resolution` | `"native"` | `HALO_RESOLUTION` | What fullscreen and borderless draw at: `"native"`, the display's own resolution, or `"<width>x<height>"`, such as `"1920x1080"`, 640x480 or more. Fullscreen sets the display to it. Borderless draws at it and scales the picture to the display, where the display has room for it. The picture has 480 lines of the game and the width of the resolution's shape. A window draws at its own size instead. Video Setup's Resolution sets it, from the display's modes; it shows with Fullscreen and Borderless. |
| `display.resolution_scaling` | `"native"` | `HALO_RESOLUTION_SCALING` | `"native"`: the game draws at the resolution of the window, or of the display (or `display.resolution`) fullscreen. `"original"`: the game draws the 640x480 picture of the Xbox and scales it up to the window or the display, whatever `display.mode` is. Video Setup sets it. |
| `display.window_size` | `""` | `HALO_WINDOW_SIZE` | The size of the window, as `"<width>x<height>"`, such as `"1920x1080"`, 640x480 or more. You can change the size of the window; the game's picture takes its shape. Empty: `display.window_scale` decides. Video Setup's Window Size sets it, from sizes of each shape (4:3, 16:10, 16:9 and 21:9) that fit the desktop; it shows with Windowed. |
| `display.window_scale` | `2` | `HALO_WINDOW_SCALE` | Used when `display.window_size` is empty: the size of the window, as a multiple of 640x480. |
| `display.vsync` | `true` | `HALO_NO_VSYNC=1` sets `false` | `true`: each frame waits for the display. |
| `display.max_fps` | `0` | `HALO_MAX_FPS` | With vsync off, the most frames each second. `0`: twice the display's refresh rate. `-1`: no limit, which can hang some Intel graphics (Raptor Lake), resetting the desktop's graphics too. |
| `display.anti_aliasing` | `"off"` | `HALO_ANTI_ALIASING` | The smoothing of jagged edges, which the Xbox did not have. `"off"`: none, as on the Xbox. `"fxaa"` or `"smaa"`: a pass over the 3D view after the game draws it. The HUD and the menus stay sharp. SMAA is the sharper and costs more. `"ssaa2x"`: the game draws at two times the resolution in each direction (at most the GPU's largest texture), and the picture is scaled down. The GPU does four times the work. Not with `display.resolution_scaling = "original"`. `"msaa2x"`, `"msaa4x"` or `"msaa8x"`: each pixel of the 3D view has that many samples (at most the GPU's). On Android, `"smaa"` gives FXAA and `"ssaa2x"` none. A change applies from the next frame. Refer to "Anti-aliasing" in "What operates". |
| `debug.gpu_flush_draws` | `-1` | `HALO_GPU_FLUSH_DRAWS` | Flush the GPU's pipeline every this many draws. `-1`: every 3 on Intel graphics with Mesa's driver, which can otherwise hang in the game's long runs of small draws and reset the desktop's graphics too. `0`: never. |
| `display.interpolation` | `true` | `HALO_INTERPOLATION` | `true`: one frame for each refresh of the display. `false`: 30 frames each second, as on the Xbox. Refer to "Frame rate". |
| `display.direct_camera` | `true` | `HALO_DIRECT_CAMERA` | `true`: in first person, on foot, the view points where the player aims in each frame, not where the last tick left it. Refer to "Frame rate". |
| `display.high_res_hud` | `true` | `HALO_HIGH_RES_HUD` | `true`: the HUD (meters, counters, panels and their outlines, the motion sensor, reticles, waypoints, scopes) is drawn from the high-res assets in `port/assets/hud`, 8x the size of the maps' bitmaps. The bitmaps with English text keep the maps' own. `false`: the maps' own bitmaps. |
| `display.high_res_text` | `true` | `HALO_HIGH_RES_TEXT` | `true`: the menus' and HUD's text is drawn with the fonts in `port/assets/fonts` (Overpass, in place of the maps' Interstate) at the resolution the game draws at, laid out as before, and the menus' titles are drawn from the high-res pictures in `port/assets/titles`. `false`: the maps' bitmap fonts and titles. |
| `display.shadow_resolution` | `128` | `HALO_SHADOW_RESOLUTION` | The size of the maps that the shadows of the objects are drawn in, in pixels each way: `128`, `256`, `512` or `1024` (other values go down to one of these). The game draws the shadow of each object into a map of 128x128 pixels, blurs it and projects it onto the ground. On a large screen, the edges of these shadows show steps that move when the object moves. A larger map makes the edges smooth; the blur is made wider to match, so the shadows are as soft as on the Xbox. Each doubling adds two passes of the blur. `128`: as on the Xbox. |
| `display.menus` | `"pc"` | `HALO_MENUS` | `"pc"` (Arena Evolved's default): the PC version's menus, where AE's settings are, from the files in `port/assets/menus` and a `menus` folder next to `config.toml`. `"xbox"`: the Xbox's menus, with Online Games (ChupathingyCE's default). Refer to "Menus". |
| `display.player_names` | `"all"` | `HALO_PLAYER_NAMES` | In multiplayer, whose names are drawn above their heads: `"all"`, `"allies"`, `"enemies"` or `"none"`. An ally's name is drawn above the triangle the game shows over teammates. An enemy's name shows only within the motion sensor's reach, while the enemy is in sight and not camouflaged, so it never shows where an enemy hides. The gametype's motion tracker setting also applies: no names if it shows no players, only allies' if it shows only friends. |
| `display.player_name_scale` | `1.0` | `HALO_PLAYER_NAME_SCALE` | How large the players' names are drawn: `1.0` is three quarters of the size of the HUD's text, from `0.25` to `4`. With high-res text, larger names are rasterized at their size, so they stay sharp. |
| `display.scoreboard_team_layout` | `"teams"` | `HALO_SCOREBOARD_TEAM_LAYOUT` | How the multiplayer scoreboard (hold BACK, or tab) lists a team game's players. `"teams"`: a column for each team, red on the left and blue on the right. `"score"`: all the players in order of score. With more players than fit, the mouse wheel and Page Up / Page Down scroll the scoreboard. |
| `display.scoreboard_background` | `true` | `HALO_SCOREBOARD_BACKGROUND` | `true`: the multiplayer scoreboard (hold BACK, or tab) has a panel behind its text, for clearer text. |
| `display.show_quit_players` | `true` | `HALO_SHOW_QUIT_PLAYERS` | `true`: players who quit stay on the multiplayer scoreboard (hold BACK, or tab) and the score in the corner, as in the original game. `false`: they are left off, and the players still in the game are ranked among themselves, as OpenCE does. Only what this machine draws changes. |
| `display.scoreboard_background_color` | `"16, 16, 16, 150"` | `HALO_SCOREBOARD_BACKGROUND_COLOR` | The colour of the scoreboard's panel: `"red, green, blue, alpha"`, each from `0` to `255`. Alpha `0` is see-through, `255` is solid. |
| `display.match_clock` | `"down"` | `HALO_MATCH_CLOCK` | The match clock: in a multiplayer game, M:SS in the bottom right corner of each view, lined up with the motion sensor (as far from the right edge as the sensor is from the left, level with its range). The scoreboard (hold BACK, or tab) shows the time played and, with a time limit, the time left, whichever way the corner counts. `"down"`: the time left of the gametype's time limit; with no time limit, the time played. `"up"`: the time played. `"off"`: no clock. It shows game time, the same on each machine, and hides during PRE-GAME COUNTDOWN and after the game. On Halo 1: NHE's maps, the clock takes the place of their own clock (their Cortana callouts stay); `"off"` leaves their clock. Settings > Game Options sets it. |
| `display.power_list` | `"clock"` | `HALO_POWER_LIST` | Where the gametype's TIMERS and TRAINING list the power items' next spawns. `"clock"`: a column stacked over the match clock in the bottom right corner (the soonest at the foot, a cap over the clock's digits; NAME and TIME aligned, the times flush right on the clock's right edge in tabular figures; at most four lines, the three soonest and `+N`; hidden while the view's scoreboard shows). `"top_left"`: with one view, the earlier single line in the top left corner, as before: it moves down under the performance overlay's line (`display.performance`, at the top left) where the two would meet, and under the ammo and grenades there, moving the HUD's messages down under it. Split-screen views always have the column. `"top_left"` is config-only for now (`config.toml` or `HALO_POWER_LIST`): Settings has no row for it. |
| `display.campaign_timer` | `false` | `HALO_CAMPAIGN_TIMER` | `true`: in the campaign, M:SS in the bottom right corner of each view (where the match clock is, lined up with the motion sensor): the time played on the level, as the Master Chief Collection's campaign timer. Game time, a tick at a time: it stops in the pause menu and while loading, and the cutscenes count (it is hidden while they play). A revert to a checkpoint does not take time back; a new level or the level started again starts it at 0:00; a saved game resumed from the main menu starts from that save's game time. Co-op views show the same time. Settings > Game Options sets it (CAMPAIGN TIMER). |
| `display.hud_area` | `"full"` | `HALO_HUD_AREA` | Where the HUD is drawn on a screen wider than 16:9 or 4:3. `"full"`: out to the edges of the screen, as before. `"16:9"` or `"4:3"`: within a part of the screen of that shape, as tall as the screen, at its middle (with its own title-safe margin): the meters, the motion sensor, the ammo, the messages, the scoreboard, the postgame's screens and the score in the corner, the match clock and the power list, and the arrows of waypoints that are off screen. The view itself stays the full width, and the reticle, the scope and waypoints in sight stay where they are in the view. In split screen, the sides of views at the screen's edges move in and the sides where views meet stay; on a screen no wider than the area, nothing moves. Settings > Game Options sets it. |
| `display.compact_hud` | `false` | `HALO_COMPACT_HUD` | `true`: with one player, the HUD is the game's split-screen HUD: the unit's split-screen meters, the weapons' elements for split screen, the smaller motion sensor (three quarters), and the messages in the smaller font, three at a time. The reticle and the scoreboard stay as they are. With two or more players, the HUD is always the split-screen HUD. Settings > Game Options sets it. |
| `display.scoreboard_fade` | `"normal"` | `HALO_SCOREBOARD_FADE` | How fast the in-game scoreboard (hold BACK, or tab) fades in and out. `"instant"`: no fade. `"fast"`: a quarter of a second. `"normal"`: half a second, as in the original game. `"slow"`: one second. Settings > Game Options sets it. |
| `display.spawn_heat` | `"mine"` | `HALO_SPAWN_HEAT` | The gametype's TRAINING spawn markers coloured by how likely each spawn is to be picked next, by CE's own rules (the game type's spawns, none with a vehicle on it, CTF's own team's, none within 2 units of an enemy and fewer within 5, up to ten times more near teammates; the pick is the highest rating times the square root of a random number, so the chance is worked out, never drawn). `"mine"`: where your player would spawn now, your own unit left out as if dead. `"enemy"`: where the other team would spawn (team games; without teams it is as `"mine"`). `"off"`: the plain green markers. The colour is the chance over the likeliest spawn's: cold blue-grey, green, yellow, hot orange-red (alpha 0.35 to 0.85); the one likeliest pulses; when the spawns that can be picked are near uniform (the least likely at least 80% as likely as the likeliest) they are all the scale's middle (green), none pulsing; markers and flashes fade as the camera comes within 4 units, to a fifth at 1.5 units and nearer (one underfoot stays faint); a spawn that can't be picked now is dark red with a cross; the other team's CTF spawns are faint in their colour. A player's real spawn flashes a ring for 1.5 s (team colour, white without teams) and debug.txt has `spawn: player N at spawn I (P was X%)`. Worked out five times a second on each machine from what it has (nothing is sent; the game's random numbers are untouched), for each view in split screen. Settings > Game Options sets it. |
| `display.per_pixel_lighting` | `false` | `HALO_PER_PIXEL_LIGHTING` | `false`: the models (characters, weapons, vehicles, scenery) are lit at each vertex and the light is blended between them, as on the Xbox. The light across a curved surface then shows facets, and a point light that passes close lights only the vertices it reaches. `true`: the models are lit at each pixel by the same lights (the ambient light, two distant lights and two point lights), which changes their look. |
| `audio.enabled` | `true` | `HALO_NO_AUDIO=1` sets `false` | `false`: no audio device. The sound continues without output. |
| `audio.volume` | `1.0` | `HALO_VOLUME` | The master volume. |
| `audio.music_volume` | `1.0` | `HALO_MUSIC_VOLUME` | The music's volume, of the master volume. |
| `audio.effects_volume` | `1.0` | `HALO_EFFECTS_VOLUME` | The volume of the other sounds (effects and speech), of the master volume. |
| `audio.buffer_frames` | `2048` on macOS, `512` elsewhere | `HALO_AUDIO_BUFFER_FRAMES` | The audio device's buffer, in sample frames at 48 kHz, from `64` to `8192`. Larger rides out stalls that would cut the sound out; smaller has less delay (512 is 11 ms, 2048 is 43 ms). |
| `audio.reverb` | `true` | `HALO_REVERB` | `true`: the sounds of the world reverberate as the place the player is in does: the sound environments of the maps (a corridor, a cave, a large hall, outdoors) set the reverberation, as the I3DL2 reverb of the Xbox did. A sound behind a wall or a door is muffled in it too. `false`: no reverberation (sounds behind a wall are still muffled). |
| `audio.resampling` | `"sinc"` | `HALO_AUDIO_RESAMPLING` | How the sounds, most of them recorded at 22 kHz, are brought to the output's 48 kHz. `"sinc"`: a windowed sinc low pass keeps each sound's band (flat to about 9 kHz for a 22 kHz sound) and nothing above it. `"linear"`: linear interpolation, as before OpenCE's build 130: the top of each sound's band is duller (-4 dB at 8 kHz) and images of the band reach up to 22 kHz, a brighter, grainier sound. |
| `capture.ffmpeg_path` | `""` | `HALO_FFMPEG` | The ffmpeg program for recordings: its path, or a name to look for on the `PATH`. Empty: `ffmpeg` next to the game, else on the `PATH`. Refer to "Screenshots and recordings". |
| `capture.record_fps` | `60` | `HALO_RECORD_FPS` | The frames a second of a recording, `60` or `30` (another value is `60`). |
| `capture.record_quality` | `"medium"` | `HALO_RECORD_QUALITY` | The quality and size of a recording: `"low"`, `"medium"` or `"high"` (H.264 at CRF 28, 23 or 18). |
| `capture.record_indicator` | `true` | `HALO_RECORD_INDICATOR` | `true`: a red dot at the top right while recording. It is never in the recording. |
| `capture.record_directory` | `""` | `HALO_RECORD_DIR` | The folder for recordings. Empty: `recordings/` next to `config.toml`. |
| `input.mouse_sensitivity` | `1.0` | `HALO_MOUSE_SENSITIVITY` | The multiplier for the mouse aim. |
| `input.mouse_vertical_sensitivity` | `0.0` | `HALO_MOUSE_VERTICAL_SENSITIVITY` | The multiplier for the vertical mouse aim. `0`: the same as `input.mouse_sensitivity`. |
| `input.invert_mouse` | `false` | `HALO_MOUSE_INVERT=1` sets `true` | `true`: the vertical mouse aim is inverted. |
| `input.mouse_aim_assist` | `false` | `HALO_MOUSE_AIM_ASSIST` | `true`: the magnetism of the controller also operates for the mouse. `false`: when the mouse moved after the right stick, the view is not slowed or dragged by a target. The autoaim of the bullets operates in both cases. |
| `controls.<action>` | (the table in "Controls") | `HALO_KEY_<ACTION>` | The keys and mouse buttons of an action, up to two, separated by a comma: `move_forward`, `move_backward`, `strafe_left`, `strafe_right`, `jump`, `crouch`, `fire`, `throw_grenade`, `melee`, `reload`, `zoom`, `switch_weapon`, `switch_grenade`, `action`, `flashlight`, `scoreboard`, `pause`. Keys by their names (`"W"`, `"Space"`, `"Left Ctrl"`, `"F1"`), and `"Mouse Left"`, `"Mouse Right"`, `"Mouse Middle"`, `"Mouse 4"`, `"Mouse 5"`, `"Wheel"` (either way), `"Wheel Up"`, `"Wheel Down"`. |
| `game.console_log` | `"important"` | `HALO_CONSOLE_LOG` | What the console shows on the screen. `"important"`: bans, players that the host drops for cheating, the reasons that the game refuses a command, and the asserts that stop the game. `"all"`: all the lines. `"none"`: only the asserts that stop the game. The output of a command always shows. `debug.txt` gets all the lines. |
| `game.fall_damage` | `true` | `HALO_FALL_DAMAGE` | In the campaign: `true`, falls hurt players. `false`: landings never hurt, from any height (pits and the map's kill volumes still kill). Multiplayer uses the gametype's FALL DAMAGE (ARENA OPTIONS). Settings > Game Options sets it (CAMPAIGN FALL DAMAGE). |
| `game.health` | `"classic"` | `HALO_HEALTH` | In the campaign, how players' health comes back. `"classic"`: only from health packs. `"reach"`: once the shields are full, to the top of the third it is in. `"halo3"`: once the shields are full, all of it. `"halo2"`: all of it as the shields recharge. Multiplayer uses the gametype's HEALTH (ARENA OPTIONS). Settings > Game Options sets it (CAMPAIGN HEALTH). |
| `game.callouts` | `"off"` | `HALO_CALLOUTS` | Spoken callouts in multiplayer, on this machine only, in `game.callout_voice`'s voice, as Halo 1: NHE's voice timer says them, in any gametype. `"items"`: each power item's call (rockets, sniper, overshield, camo) 10 seconds before each of its spawns, from its real spawn time, after the pack's item beep: "rockets in ten" when the pack has the clip, else the name; "five" to "one" before the rockets'; and "rockets are up" (and so on) at each spawn when the pack has the clip. `"items_clock"`: also NHE's talking timer, by game time: a beep on each minute and "N minutes" half a second later (1 to 30, then 1 again), beeps at :20, :30 and :40, "thirty seconds left" and "twenty seconds" half a second after the last two, "ten" at :50 and "nine" to "one" at :51 to :59. `"off"`: none. One call at a time, planned ahead from the clips' lengths, the items' calls first: an item alone is called on its second (its beep before it) and is up on its spawn's tick; items spawning together (a wave) start early enough to end by the 10-second mark (up to 6 seconds early, 8 for VERBOSE); the clock's "ten" gives way to an item's call due then ("nine" to "one" go on), a beep an item's call is on is left out, a number moved later is said only if it ends before the next, and the clock's words wait (the spawn's "is up", then the minute). `game.callout_detail` says how much a wave says. A call late anyway is dropped rather than said late. Silent on Halo 1: NHE's maps (their scripts talk), during the PRE-GAME COUNTDOWN, while paused and after the game; the clip playing then stops. Each call is logged in `debug.txt` with its game tick. Settings > Game Options sets it (CALLOUTS). |
| `game.callout_detail` | `"standard"` | `HALO_CALLOUT_DETAIL` | How much the callouts (`game.callouts`) say of the power items spawning together (a wave). `"minimal"`: one line a wave (an item alone its own "<item> in ten"; more "power weapons in ten", "power items in ten" or "weapons and power items in ten" by their kinds) and only the first item's "is up"; no beeps, no five to one before the rockets, and of the clock only the minutes and "thirty seconds left". `"standard"`: the item beep, an overshield and a camo as one line ("overshield and camo in ten" / "are up"), three items or more as the line of their kinds (and its "... are up" at the spawn), else each item's call, and each "is up". `"verbose"`: every item named, from the pack's clips ("rockets, sniper and overshield in ten": names, "and", "in ten"; the overshield and an OS/CAMO spot last, as their own "... in ten"), then each item's own "is up" in turn; a wave that can't be said so within 8 seconds is said as `"standard"`. Settings > Game Options sets it (CALLOUT DETAIL). |
| `game.callout_voice` | `"cori"` | `HALO_CALLOUT_VOICE` | The callouts' voice: a folder of `voices/` in the data root (refer to "Files and folders"), or of the mod's `mods/<mod>/voices/`, read as a map starts. A mod's own `mods/<mod>/voices/<folder>/` clips come first (an unreadable one gives way to the `voices/` copy). With no such folder, the first folder of `voices/` by name speaks and the setting stays as it is. 16-bit PCM WAVs, mono or stereo, at any rate; a missing or unusable clip is skipped and logged with why. Every build ships the beta voice `cori` (Piper's en_GB-cori-high, public domain, CC0 clips; `port/assets/voices/cori`), copied beside the game as `voices/` (Android's APK does not carry it yet); a player's own import of Halo 1: NHE's clips (`nhe`) is optional. Settings > Game Options sets it (VOICE: the folders of `voices/` and of the mod's `voices/`). |
| `game.language` | `""` | `HALO_LANGUAGE` | The language of the menus: `ja`, `de`, `fr`, `es` or `it`. Empty: English. |

| `network.join_from_clipboard` | `true` | `HALO_NET_JOIN_FROM_CLIPBOARD` | `true`: when the game comes to the front, it joins the game of an invite link on the clipboard. |
| `network.tunnel_port` | `0` | `HALO_NET_TUNNEL_PORT` | The UDP port for internet play. `0`: the game selects a port. Refer to "Internet play". |
| `network.allow_upnp` | `true` | `HALO_NET_ALLOW_UPNP` | `true`: internet play can ask the router to forward its port (UPnP). `false`: the game does not ask. Refer to "Internet play". |
| `network.protocol` | `"auto"` | `HALO_NET_PROTOCOL` | Delta Peer, the messages between ChupathingyCE machines beside OpenCE's protocol (UDP port 5160; `docs/delta.md`). `"auto"`: Delta with the machines that speak it, plain OpenCE with the others. `"opence"`: Delta off. `"delta"`: as `"auto"` for now. |
| `network.share_profile` | `false` | `HALO_NET_SHARE_PROFILE` | `true`: the other ChupathingyCE players of a game see this copy's player ID (its game list profile), over Delta. |

| `network.host_platform_limits` | `true` | `HALO_NET_HOST_PLATFORM_LIMITS` | `true`: a game this machine hosts keeps to the players its Delta machines' platforms take. `false`: their limits are ignored, for testing. |
| `network.public_lobby` | `true` | `HALO_NET_PUBLIC_LOBBY` | `true`: the server browser. Public games are listed, and Join Game > Server Browser shows them. `false`: no games are listed or shown. Refer to "Server browser". |
| `network.host_public` | `true` | `HALO_NET_HOST_PUBLIC` | `true`: a new game of Create Game > Internet starts as PUBLIC. `false`: it starts as PRIVATE. LISTING in Server Setup changes it for each game. Refer to "Server browser". |
| `network.coop_friendly_fire` | `"on"` | `HALO_NET_COOP_FRIENDLY_FIRE` | Whether the players of an online co-op game hurt each other: `"off"`, `"on"`, `"shields_only"` or `"explosives_only"`. FRIENDLY FIRE in co-op's Server Setup writes its choice here. Their AI allies they always can, as in the campaign. |
| `network.coop_player_collisions` | `true` | `HALO_NET_COOP_PLAYER_COLLISIONS` | Whether the players of an online co-op game bump into each other. `false`: they walk through each other, so that one cannot block a doorway or stand on another; they still bump into the AI's characters. PLAYER COLLISIONS in co-op's Server Setup writes its choice here. |
| `network.coop_enemies_mode` | `"per_player"` | `HALO_NET_COOP_ENEMIES_MODE` | Online co-op's extra enemies: `"none"`; `"per_player"`, each squad of enemies that a level places grows by `network.coop_enemies` for each player past the first; or `"multiplier"`, each squad is `network.coop_enemies_multiplier` times as large, for any number of players. The extra enemies stand around the squad's places, and those that a dropship has no seats for drop out of it after its passengers. EXTRA ENEMIES in co-op's Server Setup writes its choice here. |
| `network.coop_enemies` | `50` | `HALO_NET_COOP_ENEMIES` | The extra enemies per player, a percentage from `25` to `200`: for each player past the first, each squad of enemies gets this much of itself more (`100`: as many again, so four players meet four times the squad). PER PLAYER in co-op's Server Setup writes its choice here. |
| `network.coop_enemies_multiplier` | `2` | `HALO_NET_COOP_ENEMIES_MULTIPLIER` | The static multiplier of the enemies, `2` to `32`: each squad of enemies is this many times as large. MULTIPLIER in co-op's Server Setup writes its choice here. |
| `network.coop_public` | `false` | `HALO_NET_COOP_PUBLIC` | `true`: an online co-op game (Create Game > Internet, a SINGLEPLAYER map) starts as PUBLIC. `false`: it starts as PRIVATE. LISTING in co-op's Server Setup writes its choice here. Refer to "Server browser". |

It changes nothing in Arena Evolved, whose wire ID (`ae-20a`) those tables have no row for. `false`: no fetch. |
| `network.legacy_table` | `""` | `HALO_LEGACY_TABLE` | For testing, and for admins: a legacy table file, not signed, next to `config.toml` unless a full path. Its row for the wire of the build sets the OpenCE network versions that the game announces and joins, in place of the signed tables. The log shows a warning at start. Refer to `docs/delta.md`. Empty: none. |

| `crash_reports.upload` | `"ask"` | `HALO_CRASH_REPORTS` | No effect in Arena Evolved, whose builds send no crash reports. Where they are on (OpenCE's numbered Windows builds): `"yes"`: the game sends a report of each crash to the developers. `"no"`: the game sends no reports. `"ask"`: the game asks at the next crash and writes the answer here. Refer to "Crash reports" in [port/windows/README.md](../windows/README.md#crash-reports). |

Use the first two to test the netcode as on the internet, and the others to test that nothing another machine sends can crash the game (a damaged stream is closed, so a little goes a long way; a host's messages to its own client are damaged too, so start damaging once the game has started). |
| `debug.telnet_console`, `debug.telnet_console_port` | `false`, `2323` | `HALO_TELNET_CONSOLE`, `HALO_TELNET_CONSOLE_PORT` | The game listens on 127.0.0.1, on this port, for a script console (connect with telnet). The console has no password, so only this computer can reach it. |

With Mesa drivers, the game sends its GL calls through the GL thread of
Mesa. To stop this, set the environment variable `mesa_glthread=false`.

## Updates

Arena Evolved does not update itself: no build of it (a release's
included) looks for a new version or downloads one, whatever `update.auto`
says. Get a new version from the
[Releases](https://github.com/PeterRichardsonGolf/Halo-CE-Arena-Evolved/releases)
page. The updater it inherited from ChupathingyCE stays in the code, off
(`src/updater.c`, and the Android app's `Updater.java`), so that it can
never offer or install a ChupathingyCE build. What follows is how that
updater works when it is on.

The builds from GitHub Actions (refer to the main [README](../../README.md#download))
can update themselves. At start-up, the game asks GitHub for the latest
release. The game does not wait for the answer. If the latest release is not
newer, the game does nothing.

If the latest release is newer, the game asks: "Do you want to update?"

- Select "Yes" to update. The game downloads the release for this platform,
  replaces its files and starts the new version. The old files get the
  extension `.old`. The new version deletes them.
- Select "No" to continue. The game asks again at the next start.
- Select "Do not ask again", then "Yes", to stop the questions. The game
  writes `auto = false` in the `[update]` section of `config.toml`. To get
  the questions again, set `auto = true`.

Under gamescope (the Game Mode of the Steam Deck), the game does not ask,
because a system dialog stops the game there. The game writes the new
version in the log. To update, start the game from the desktop, or set
`update_answer = "yes"` in the `[debug]` section of `config.toml`.

The game downloads through HTTPS. It examines the certificate of the server
against the certificate authorities of the system: on Linux, the bundle of
the distribution (`src/posix_update.c`, with Mbed TLS); on Windows, the
certificate store of Windows (WinHTTP). The folder of the executable must
let the game write to it.

Builds that you make yourself have no build number. They do not look for
updates.

## Frame rate

The game calculates its world at 30 Hz, as on the Xbox. On the Xbox, the
game showed one frame for each calculation (tick). This port shows one frame
for each refresh of the display, for example at 60, 120 or 240 Hz.

Each frame shows the world between the last two ticks
(`game/render_interpolation.c`):

- After each tick, the game keeps the camera, the position of each part of
  each object, and the first-person weapon.
- Each frame mixes the last two ticks. The mix agrees with the time since
  the last tick.
- Rotations use quaternions. Positions and scales are linear.
- A teleport, a respawn or a cut of the camera does not mix. It jumps.

Thus the frames are one tick (33 ms) after the calculation. The calculation
does not change.

The direction of the view is an exception. The game reads the mouse and the
sticks in each frame. In first person, on foot, each frame points the view
where the player aims at that time (`display.direct_camera`). Thus the view
turns in the frame that the mouse moves. In a vehicle and in cinematics, the
view mixes as the other things do. On Android, the view mixes as before.

To get 30 frames each second, set `display.interpolation = false`.

To see the frame rate:

1. Push \` to open the developer console.
2. Enter `display_framerate true`.

In the game of another host, the console runs only the commands that change
nothing of the game (such as `display_framerate`), and the game puts back
cheats, the game speed and the settings of the drawing that show more of
the world (such as `rasterizer_wireframe`). Refer to `NETCODE.md`.

The frame rate shows at the bottom right of the screen. It is the mean over
half a second.

## System link

The Xbox game lets 16 players on 4 machines play a system link game. This
port lets up to 128 players on up to 128 machines play. Each machine can
have up to 4 players (split screen).

- `include/halo_port_limits.h` sets the limits.
- `include/halo_port_capacity.h` sets the memory for the limits. The game
  state is 16 MB at `0x81A00000` (3.3 MB on the Xbox). The pools of objects,
  effects, particles, contrails, lights and sounds are also larger.

Obey these rules:

- All the machines in a game must use a build with the same limits.
- The port uses protocol version 2. It does not see the Xbox game or older
  builds of the port. They do not see the port.

These are the differences from the Xbox:

- The host waits up to 60 seconds (15 seconds on the Xbox) for the other
  machines to load the map.
- If a machine does not read the messages of the host for two seconds, the
  host removes it from the game.
- The saved games contain all the game state. Thus a saved game is 16 MB.
  Saved games from older builds of the port do not operate.
- In campaign and in games of up to 16 players, the game removes garbage
  (bodies, dropped weapons) as on the Xbox. In larger games, it keeps more
  garbage, in proportion to the players.
- The lobby shows the local machine and the first three remote machines.
  The other machines are also in the game.
- In free-for-all games, each player is a team.

The gametype's options from ARENA OPTIONS and the indicator options
(FALL DAMAGE, HEALTH, NO SPREAD, PRE-GAME COUNTDOWN, PRACTICE MODE, TIMERS,
TRAINING) go to every machine with the gametype. A machine of this port
plays and shows them all. A machine of another build (OpenCE,
ChupathingyCE) keeps its own display and its own shots' spread, but the
host decides what it can: it respawns items for PRACTICE MODE, and it holds
every machine to the PRE-GAME COUNTDOWN. During the countdown the host
refuses a client's own moves and its hits made before the countdown ends,
and keeps the client's player at its spawn. Refer to "PRE-GAME COUNTDOWN"
in `NETCODE.md`.

Linux, Windows and Android machines can play in the same game. Each machine
simulates the players from the same inputs, and the host does not correct
all of the game. Thus each machine must calculate the same floating-point
results, and all the ports:

- Compile without fused multiply-add (`-ffp-contract=off`).
- Use the math functions of musl (`port/include/halo_math.h`,
  `port/third_party/musl-math`), not the math functions of the system.

### Play on one computer

More than one copy of the game can play on one computer. Each copy must
have a different loopback address. A copy with an address gets no
broadcasts. Thus each copy must send its broadcasts to the other copies.

For a host and two clients, enter these commands in three terminals:

```sh
HALO_NET_ADDRESS=127.0.0.200 HALO_NET_BROADCAST=127.0.0.201,127.0.0.202 build/linux/halo
HALO_NET_ADDRESS=127.0.0.201 HALO_NET_BROADCAST=127.0.0.200 build/linux/halo
HALO_NET_ADDRESS=127.0.0.202 HALO_NET_BROADCAST=127.0.0.200 build/linux/halo
```

Do not give 127.0.0.1 to a copy. Each copy gets to its own address through
127.0.0.1. Linux and Windows send all of 127.0.0.0/8 to the loopback
interface.

### Test with many machines

`tools/system_link_bots.py` adds simple machines to a game. Each machine has
one player. The machines obey the system link protocol, but they do not
calculate the game. By default their players stand still.

1. Start a game on the host.
2. Enter `python tools/system_link_bots.py --host 127.0.0.200 --machines 127 --start`.

Each machine uses its own loopback address, from 127.0.0.2. The option
`--start` starts the game when all the machines are in the lobby. If the
host has no `network.address`, do not give `--host`.

Add `--move` to make the players move. Each machine then sends its player's
input to the host every tick, as a real client does. The players run, strafe,
turn, jump and crouch in random patterns (`--seed N` picks other ones). Add
`--fire` to make them shoot in bursts too. The host moves the players from
this input. Their shots do not hurt anyone, because the bots do not report
hits. The bots do not aim, follow paths or pick up items.

## Internet play

Machines with an invite link can play system link on the internet. This
project has no server.

When a copy of the game starts to host a system link game, it makes an
invite link: `halo://join/<64 hexadecimal digits>`. The game writes the link
to the standard error and puts it on the clipboard. The links of older
versions of the game (44 digits) do not operate. The game writes a message
when it gets one.

To join a game, do one of these steps:

- Open the link. The game is the handler of `halo://` links. If the game
  already operates, the new copy gives the link to it and stops. A key in a
  file that only the user can read (`halo-ce-universal.key` in
  `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR`, else `~/.halo-ce-universal.key`; on Windows in
  `%LOCALAPPDATA%`) encrypts the link, so the programs of other users cannot
  read it.
- Copy the link (or the 64 digits) and go to the game.
- Enter `halo <link>`.
- Accept a Discord invite. Refer to "Discord".

When the machines connect, the game of the host shows in Multiplayer,
System Link. Join the game as on a local network. System link on a local
network does not need an invite.

### Server browser

Server Setup in Create Game > Internet has a LISTING row:

- PUBLIC (the default): the game also shows in Join Game > Server Browser
  on every machine. Anyone can see and join the game.
- PRIVATE: only players with the invite link can join.

Each new game starts as PUBLIC (`network.host_public = false` makes new
games start as PRIVATE). An online co-op game starts as PRIVATE, and keeps
the last choice of its LISTING (`network.coop_public`). A LAN game is never listed. `network.public_lobby = false` turns the server browser off.

A PUBLIC game can also have a PASSWORD (a row of Server Setup, below
LISTING). The Server Browser shows a lock at the left of a game with a
password. A player who selects that game must type the password, and JOIN
GAME joins only with the correct password. The invite link of the game joins
it without the password. The host keeps the password only while the game
runs.

In the Server Browser, select a game to join it. The game joins the invite
of the game, as for a link. When it reaches the host, it opens the lobby.
If it cannot reach the host in 30 seconds, it marks the game FAILED. A game
that is full or starting shows CLOSED. REFRESH asks the hosts for their
listings again.

How it operates (`src/p2p_lobby.c`):

- The host of a public game publishes a listing: the invite, and the name,
  map, gametype and player counts of the game. The listing goes to the
  same MQTT brokers as the invites (`network.brokers_file`), retained,
  to a topic of the host (`hceu/3/lobby/s/<hash of its key>`).
- The key of the host signs the listing (Ed25519). The key is the key of the
  invite, so no other machine can list the invite of the host, change its
  listing, or list a game with false details.
- The host publishes the listing again every 30 seconds, when the game
  changes, and when a browser asks. If the topic of the host is empty or
  holds another listing, the host publishes again in 5 seconds or less. Thus
  a broker that deletes the listing does not remove the game.
- When the host stops (it stops hosting, the game becomes private, or the
  game quits), it publishes a closed listing, and then empties its topic.
  If the host loses its connection, the broker empties its topic (the will
  of the connection). A browser removes a game that it does not hear for 90
  seconds.
- When a public game becomes private, the host makes a new invite. Thus a
  player who saw the listing cannot join with the old invite.
- The listing of a game with a password does not hold the invite in clear
  text. The secret part of the invite (its token) is encrypted with a key
  from the password (Argon2id, salted with the key of the host, then
  XChaCha20-Poly1305). The browser makes the key from the password that the
  player types, and opens the invite only if the password is correct. When
  the host sets or changes the password, it makes a new invite. A player who
  has the listing can try passwords on their own machine without the host,
  so use a long password.

A public game does not publish the address of the host. But any machine
with the invite can ask the host to connect, and the host then sends its
addresses. Thus anyone can learn the address of the host of a public game,
as for any public server.

The brokers are in `brokers.txt` next to the executable (from
`port/assets/network/brokers.txt`; on Android, the app writes it next to
`config.toml` at each start), one `host:port` on each line. The game uses
all of them at once (up to 4), so one that works is enough. Without the
file (the dedicated server's container, the macOS application, whose
`config.toml` is in Application Support), the game uses its own copy of the
list. An update replaces `brokers.txt`: to use brokers of your own, put them in another
file and name it in `network.brokers_file`. All the players must use the
same broker to see each other's games. The game uses
MQTT 5 if the broker has it, else MQTT 3.1.1. A broker that does not keep
retained messages, or does not let clients subscribe with wildcards, carries
only invites, not listings.

ChupathingyCE's own parts of the server browser:

- A game hosted from the Xbox menus (System Link, or Online Games) is an
  internet game too, and public as `network.host_public` says, so it shows
  in the Server Browser of OpenCE and ChupathingyCE. The dedicated server
  (`server/`) is public unless `HALO_DEDICATED_PUBLIC=false`.
- Builds with the game list (`configure.py --game-browser`) also show the
  games of `network.browser_url` (halo.milenko.org). While the Server
  Browser is open, the game reads the list with an HTTPS GET of
  `/v1/games.txt` (at most every 5 seconds), and shows the games of its
  network version, not its own. A game that is also listed on the brokers
  shows once, with its listing (the same invite token). Joining a game of
  the list joins its invite, as for a link.
- A game on a Halo PC (Custom Edition) map, listed as `<map>@ce`, shows PC
  after the map's name. It can be joined only with the map in `maps/ce/`,
  on a build that plays Halo PC maps (`HALO_CUSTOM_EDITION`); otherwise
  the Server Browser says what is missing (`game/server_browser.c`).
- Column titles sort the games (players, name, map, gametype, ping). Select
  a title again to sort the other way. The chosen game stays chosen while
  the list changes. The lines below the rows show the players (by name,
  when the host sends a roster) and the rules of the chosen game.

### Security

Only machines with the invite can find the game:

- Each copy of the game makes an Ed25519 key pair when it starts, and from
  it an X25519 key pair (Monocypher, `port/third_party/monocypher`). Its
  identifier is from the hash of its X25519 public key. The Ed25519 key
  signs the listing of a public game.
- The link contains a 16-byte hash of the public key of the host and a
  random 16-byte token. The identifier of the host is from the first 6
  bytes of the hash.
- The machines exchange their public keys and addresses through public MQTT
  brokers (`network.brokers_file`). The topics are HMACs of the token.
  A key from the token encrypts and authenticates the messages
  (`src/p2p_signal.c`, `src/p2p_crypto.c`). The host authenticates its answer
  with a key that only it and the player can calculate. Its public key must
  agree with the hash in the link. The hash is long, so no other machine can
  find a key with the same hash.
- Then the player shows in the same way that it has the private key of its
  public key. Only then does the host make a session for the player. Thus
  other machines with the invite cannot make sessions in the name of a
  player (such a session would keep the player out).
- Each two machines get the keys of their packets from their key pairs and
  a random number from each. The keys do not go through the brokers. Thus
  other machines with the invite cannot read or change the packets.
- Each packet is encrypted and authenticated, with a different key in each
  direction. A machine ignores a packet that it already received.
- A machine can send only to the ports of the game on the other machine.
- The host makes one session from each request of a player. If a person
  sends a copy of an old request again, the host ignores it. A player that
  must ask again sends a new request.
- The host tries to reach at most 8 new players at the same time. The
  other players ask again.
- The host answers a request that is not proven at most one time each
  second through each broker. It answers at most 20 of these requests each
  second, after a first 32. Each answer goes only through the broker that
  brought the request. Thus a flood of requests does not use much of the
  bandwidth of the host.
- The host does the key work of at most 20 requests each second from keys
  that it does not know, after a first 32. It keeps the key work of the
  last 256 keys. Thus the proof of a player does not need more key work. A
  flood of requests can make players join more slowly. A player asks again
  for 90 seconds.
- The host refuses the predicted movement of a player whose game runs
  faster than time (a speed hack). If the messages on the player's
  connection were also ahead for ten seconds, the host drops and bans the
  player: each player sees who in red on the console, and the host adds a
  line to `cheaters.txt` and `bans.txt` (beside `debug.txt`) with the
  address and hardware id of the player, and the Discord name and id that
  the game of the player told it, marked `(self-reported)` (a player can
  change these). The host refuses a machine whose address or hardware id is
  in `bans.txt`. If only the player's datagrams were ahead, the host does
  not drop the player, because another machine can send datagrams with the
  player's address: it adds an `unverified` line to `cheaters.txt`.
- The host can ban a player with `ban <player name>` in the developer
  console (Tab completes the name). Remove a line from `bans.txt` to unban.
  Refer to `NETCODE.md`. `kick <player name>` drops the player the same
  way, but keeps nothing: no line in `bans.txt`, and the player can join
  again at once. So that every player can be named, the host trims
  the spaces around a name and removes characters that draw as nothing. A
  letter with a mark is typed as the plain letter (`ban jose` for "José").
  A name with nothing left to type becomes "Player", and a name that another
  player already has gets a number ("Player 2"). The game refuses a profile
  name that is blank, and a multiplayer game refuses a profile whose name was
  made blank before this check.
- An invite operates while the copy of the game that made it operates.

### Connection

Each machine gets its public address from public STUN servers. Then the two
machines send packets to each other until the packets get through (UDP hole
punching). There is no relay.

Some networks give a different port for each destination (for example some
mobile and company networks). Two machines behind such networks cannot
connect. To connect, forward `network.tunnel_port` on the router of one of
the machines.

The game can ask the router to forward the port (UPnP,
`src/posix_upnp.c`, with `port/third_party/miniupnpc`):

- The host asks its router when a player uses its invite.
- A player that joins asks its router when it does not reach the host in
  5 seconds.
- The forwarded port is one more address that the machine gives to the
  other machine.
- The forward has a duration of one hour. The game makes it longer while
  it operates. When the game stops normally, it removes the forward. It
  does not remove the forward after a crash, or if a request to the router
  is still under way 3 seconds after the game starts to stop. Some routers only make forwards without a duration.
- When the game finds the router, it removes the forwards to this machine
  that have the description "Halo internet play" and that no copy of the
  game uses now (forwards that a copy of the game did not remove).
- UPnP does not help behind a second NAT, for example the NAT of a mobile
  network provider. Then the router has a private address, and the game
  does not ask.

To stop all UPnP requests, set `network.allow_upnp` to `false`.

In the game, each machine has an address in 100.64.0.0/10:

- `src/xnet.c` gives the datagrams that the bound UDP sockets of the game
  send to such an address to `src/p2p.c`. Other datagrams (of sockets that
  are not bound yet, or that are connected to the address) and the TCP
  connections of the game go through local sockets on 127.0.0.1 (or
  `network.address`). The traffic from the other machines comes to the
  game from local sockets too.
- `src/p2p.c` sends that traffic through one UDP socket. UDP datagrams go
  as they are. TCP connections go as KCP streams (`port/third_party/kcp`).
- The broadcasts of the game go to all the machines. Thus the game of the
  host shows on the other machines.

### Discord

If the Discord desktop client operates, the game of the host shows in
Discord (through the application of `discord.application_id`). The activity
has a private party with the invite as its join secret. The host can send
the invite with the invite button of Discord. When a person accepts it, that
person joins the game. If the game does not operate, Discord starts it.
The game sends the activity only to a Discord client of the same user.

### Online Games and the profile

Builds with the game list (`configure.py --game-browser`) have Online Games
in the Multiplayer menu: the games on `network.browser_url`
(halo.milenko.org). Each copy of the game has a player key in the save root
(`game_list_player.key`). The key confirms the player's lines in finished
games. The game sends the key only to an HTTPS server, or to a server on
this computer (`http://127.0.0.1`, `http://localhost`) for tests.

To link the game to a profile on the site, do one of these steps in Online
Games:

- Press Start. The game opens the profile page in the web browser, signed
  in as this player.
- Press RB, or C on the keyboard (Link Profile). Use this step where no web
  browser opens: Steam's Game Mode, a Steam Deck, a console. The game shows
  a short code and a QR code. On a phone or a computer, go to
  `<server>/connect` (the address that the game shows), sign in, and enter
  the code, or scan the QR code. Then the game asks "Connect this game to
  <name>?" (or "Move this game from <old name> to <name>?"). Press A to
  connect, or B to cancel. A code operates for two minutes, and the question
  for two minutes. Press RB (or C) for a new code.

Link Profile uses these requests to the server (`src/browser.c`, on the
thread of the game list): `POST /v1/connect/start` with the key (and the
name of the profile) gives `ok <code> <seconds> <token>`.
`POST /v1/connect/status` with the token, each 3 seconds, gives `pending`,
`confirm <name> [<old name>]`, `connected <name>`, `declined` or `expired`.
`POST /v1/connect/confirm` with the token and the answer gives
`connected <name>`, `declined` or `expired`. The QR code is from
`port/third_party/qrcodegen`.

## Map checks

The game reads a map's tags straight into memory and uses them as its own
structures: every pointer, count, index and enum in them is the map's, and
the game writes values into tags as it runs. So before anything reads a
map's tags, the port checks every tag against a schema of its group
(`game/tag_schema_*.c`, read by `game/tag_validate.c`), and each structure
BSP as it loads:

- Every block and every piece of data must lie in the tags (or the BSP) and
  overlap no other. Otherwise the game refuses the map.
- A block with more elements than the game has room for is cut to the
  maximum. A tag reference that is not a tag of the right group becomes
  none. So do an index past its block and an enum past its values (or they
  become 0, where the game cannot take none). A string gets its terminator.
  Values that the game sets as it runs are reset.
- Checks that the schema cannot express run last: the BSPs' and the models'
  graphs, vertex and index buffers, and indices into other tags.

Each correction goes to `debug.txt`. The game's own maps need none.
`build/linux/map_validate [--strict] map.map...` runs the same checks on map
files without the game, and `tools/test_linux_port.py` runs it on the maps
in `assets/maps`. `map_validate --fuzz <runs> map.map` changes a few words
of the tags at random in each run. The checks must not crash or hang, and a
map that they let through must need no more corrections.

A map's scripts can call only the script functions that a map needs (the
allowlist in `hs/hs.c`). They cannot call the functions for files, the
saved state of the game, the console, debugging or cheats. A script that
calls one does not run. The developer console can call every function.

(OpenCE's; not in Arena Evolved, whose Custom Edition maps are
ChupathingyCE's: see "In Arena Evolved" below.) Halo Custom Edition maps get
the same checks (those that need OpenSauce are refused). Their own loader (`game/cache_file_formats.c`) reads them into
their tag cache at 0x40440000 and converts what Custom Edition lays out
differently, then the validator checks their tags and each of their BSPs as
it checks this build's maps, before the game converts their models, BSP
geometry and scripts. Put them with `bitmaps.map`, `sounds.map` and
`loc.map` in `custom_maps`, beside `maps`, or set `paths.custom_edition` to
a Custom Edition install; the map lists show them as CUSTOM SINGLEPLAYER and
CUSTOM MULTIPLAYER, played as campaign levels (alone, or as network co-op)
or as multiplayer maps by their scenario type, and `game.custom_edition =
false` refuses them. `map_validate` checks them too, with the resource maps
beside each map or in `--maps <folder>`. See
`docs/custom_edition_caches.md`.

Defensive checks stay in the game code too. An index into a tag block, the
tags or a tag's data that is out of range gets zeros (`tag_empty_data` in
`tag_files/tag_groups.c`), not other memory.

A map's name must be its file's: the cache file slots are found by the name
in the map's header, so a map file whose header names another map (a
renamed one) is refused, not copied again for ever. The `loading.tga` a map
pack may put in the maps folder is read only if it is an uncompressed 24-bit
picture of 320 by 240, the loading screen's texture.

A checkpoint (`savegame.bin`, in the profile's folder) and a core are
images of the game state's memory: with the data arrays' pointers to their
elements, the objects' memory pool's blocks and the references to them, and
the caches' procedures. Before one is taken, each of those is checked
against what the game made at startup (`game_state_image_accept` in
`saved games/game_state.c`): an image that does not match (a damaged or
crafted file) is refused, and the level starts over.

In Arena Evolved:

- A Custom Edition map (Halo PC's format) is checked as before
  (`game/ce_map_checks.c`), not by the Xbox schema, its structure bsps too.
  `map_validate` refuses such maps, since it reads only the Xbox's format.
- `map_validate` reads Halo 1: NHE's ui.map, a10.map and atlas.map as the
  game does (a stream short by the header's rounding). NHE's maps get many
  corrections, nearly all of them their tags' parent groups.
- A mod's map (read from `mods/<mod>/maps`) may hold bytes that are the
  same once for several structures, as CE+ X's ui.map does (`extent_claim`
  in `game/tag_validate.c`, `tag_validate_allow_shared_bytes`;
  `map_validate --mod`): an overlap is allowed only from the same first
  byte, and only where the structures are of the same kind, or share no
  runtime value and come through the check unchanged. The walk of a shared
  element may not correct it. Every other overlap is refused, and in any
  other map every overlap is, as upstream's check does.
- Halo PC's script functions and globals that ChupathingyCE adds are
  allowed in maps, and a Custom Edition map's scripts may also set
  `rasterizer_wireframe` (H2_Zanzibar's does; `hs_external_global_settable_by_ce_maps`),
  no other global the list refuses. `create_local_players` makes at most
  four players whatever `player_spawn_count` says. The main menu's
  scripts (a main menu scenario in ui.map) may also call `map_name`,
  `texture_cache_flush` and `sound_cache_flush` (CE+ X's menu does).
- Custom Edition and HaloMD maps are ChupathingyCE's (`ce_*.c`,
  `map_families.c`: `<file>@ce`, `<file>@md`), not OpenCE build-145's
  loader, whose files (`custom_edition_*.c`, `cache_file_formats.c`,
  `bmp_files.c`, `stb_vorbis.c`) stay in the tree but in no build of the
  game (`tools/linux_build.py`, `OPENCE_CUSTOM_EDITION_SOURCES`;
  `game/ae_opence_custom_edition_off.c` answers the game's calls into them
  with no such map). The `game.custom_edition` setting and the
  `custom_maps` folder are OpenCE's and not used; `paths.custom_edition`
  does nothing here. `map_validate` alone builds `cache_file_formats.c`,
  so that it checks a Custom Edition map as OpenCE's loader reads it, which
  is not how the game reads it.
- A network game's map name, which a client checks (build-140), may end in
  a map family's suffix (`<file>@ce`, `<file>@md`: `halo_map_families.h`),
  so that games of Custom Edition and HaloMD maps join.
- A Custom Edition map's structure bsps get only ChupathingyCE's checks
  (`ce_map_checks.c`'s `ce_bsp_check`, before the map opens), not
  build-139's schema, since ChupathingyCE 0.7.0b has none for them; to
  revisit when ChupathingyCE merges build-139.

## What operates

| Area | Status |
| --- | --- |
| Game code | All 466 C files of the game. The changes are in "Game source changes". |
| Graphics | Direct3D 8 on OpenGL 4.5 core through SDL3 (`src/d3d8_gl.c`). The port translates the NV2A vertex shaders and register combiners to GLSL. It decodes all the Xbox texture formats. The vertex and index buffers come from a GL copy of the Xbox memory. |
| High-res HUD | The HUD is drawn from high-res assets: redraws at 8x the size of the maps' bitmaps (4x for the largest), in `port/assets/hud`. They cover the meters, counters, panels and their outlines, the motion sensor, reticles, waypoints and scopes, but no bitmap with English text. `tools/hud_assets.py` makes them from the SVG redraws, and the build embeds them in the executable. When the game uploads one of those bitmaps, `src/hud_hires.c` gives the high-res texture in its place, if the bitmap's pixels are those of the English maps: another language's maps keep their own. The game sizes and places the HUD from its tags as before. `display.high_res_hud = false` turns this off. |
| High-res text | The menus' and HUD's text is drawn with Overpass (`port/assets/fonts`, SIL Open Font License) in place of the maps' bitmap fonts, which are Interstate. `src/text_hires.c` rasterizes each glyph with stb_truetype (`port/third_party/stb`) at the resolution the game draws at, into an atlas that a placeholder bitmap of the game stands for. The game lays the text out from its font tags as before. The menus' titles (the screens' headers and the main menu's items) are pictures of text in the maps, so they are drawn as the high-res HUD is: `tools/title_assets.py` sets each one again in OpenCE, Roger White's public-domain Newtown respaced to match the maps' commercial title typeface (`tools/title_font.py`), at 4x the bitmap's size over its own plate or glow, each letter placed where the map's letter is, in `port/assets/titles`. The postgame carnage report's title is set over a hand-made SVG redraw of its panel (`port/assets/titles/svg`) instead. `display.high_res_text = false` turns it off. |
| Anti-aliasing | Off unless `display.anti_aliasing` is set (`src/d3d8_gl.c`, `src/xgpu_post.c`). FXAA (written in the port) and SMAA (`port/third_party/smaa`, MIT licensed, at its HIGH preset, compiled as GLSL) are passes over the 3D view of each window, after the lens flares and before the HUD and the menus (`render/render.c`). Their programs are built when the setting is chosen. Supersampling draws the render targets the size of the screen at two times the resolution in each direction, and the display blit scales them down. Multisampling draws the back buffer and its depth buffer into multisampled renderbuffers, and with them any target that is drawn together with one of them (a mirror's view, in the secondary target with the back buffer's depth buffer), so that the attachments of a framebuffer are all multisampled or none is. A target's pixels are resolved into its texture before something reads the texture (as a texture, or at the display blit). Visibility tests count samples, divided by the samples of a pixel. An alpha-tested surface (foliage, grates) covers the samples of a pixel in proportion to its alpha past the reference (`gl_SampleMask`, not on Android). |
| Sound | Xbox DirectSound on SDL3 audio (`src/dsound_sdl.c`): PCM and Xbox ADPCM, mixed at 48 kHz, with volume, pitch, mix bins, distance, stereo pan, occlusion and obstruction. The world's sounds go through an I3DL2 reverb set by the map's sound environments (`audio.reverb`). There is no Doppler effect and there are no cones. A UI voice, outside the game's sound system, plays the callouts' clips (`src/callout_voice.c`) at the effects volume, dry (not through the reverb). |
| Input | XInput on SDL3 (`src/xinput_sdl.c`): keyboard, mouse, gamepads with rumble, and the debug keyboard for the console. |
| Files | The Win32 file functions and the MSVC file functions on POSIX, with the translation of Xbox paths. |
| Threads | Threads, events, mutexes, critical sections, interlocked operations and alertable waits. |
| Memory | The port reserves the Xbox memory at `0x80000000`. Thus the game gets the fixed addresses that it expects. |
| Saved games | The Xbox `UDATA` layout, with SHA-1 signatures. |
| Networking | Winsock on BSD sockets. System link on a local network and on the internet. |
| Bink video | Not available. The game skips the movies. |

## How the port operates

### The compiler

`tools/linux_build.py` compiles the game with clang and these options, which
give the ABI of the MSVC compiler:

- `--target=i686-linux-gnu`: 32-bit x86.
- `-fms-extensions`: the MSVC extensions.
- `-fshort-wchar`: 16-bit `wchar_t`.
- `-malign-double`: 8-byte alignment of 64-bit members.
- `-fcommon`: tentative definitions, as in C89.

glibc gives only ISO C (`__STRICT_ANSI__`). Thus POSIX names, for example
`random`, do not conflict with the names of the game.

These files supply the MSVC functions that clang does not have:

| File | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| `include/halo_linux_prefix.h` | The first header of each file: the architecture macros of the SDK, MSVC `__inline`, SEH keywords, `__declspec(selectany)`. |
| `include/` | Headers that add MSVC names to the C runtime headers. |
| `port/include/xdk` | The Xbox SDK declarations. The compiler reads this folder after all the other folders. |
| `tools/linux_msvc_semantics.py` | Makes a header that declares each struct tag at file scope, as MSVC does. It also makes the header inline functions weak, as the COMDAT functions of MSVC. `game/msvc_comdat.c` gives one external copy of each. |
| `include/halo_linux_winsock_names.h` | Gives new names to the Winsock functions of the SDK. Thus they do not link to the glibc functions with the same names. |
| `include/halo_linux_source_fixups.h` | Repairs one declaration conflict (`rasterizer_debug_drawing_begin`). |

`tools/linux_link_check.py` stops the link if a weak reference has no
definition. Without this check, the linker gives the reference the address
0.

### The platform layer (`src/`)

- The files `posix_*.c` use glibc. The compiler uses the ABI of the host
  for these files, because some glibc structures have a different layout
  with `-malign-double`.
- The other files include the SDK declarations through `platform.h`. Thus
  the compiler examines each definition against the SDK prototype.
- `src/halo_linker_common.c` gives weak storage for some globals of the
  January link, and for `fast_ftol_C` and `main_crash`.
- `main/d3d_intimacy.cpp` reads a private structure of the Xbox Direct3D.
  The Linux build does not use this file. `src/d3d8_gl.c` gives
  `d3d_find_flipcount`.
- The build returns small structures and unions in registers
  (`-freg-struct-return`), as on Win32.

### Game source changes

Five files of the game have changes for clang. These changes do not change
the MSVC objects: a comparison of all 612 C objects showed no difference in
code or data.

| File | Change |
| --- | --- |
| `cseries/cseries.c` | The naked function `stristr` uses `[ebp+8]` and `[ebp+12]` for its parameters. |
| `bitmaps/bitmap_drawing.c` | `*((word *)p)++` is now `*(*(word **)&p)++`. |
| `rasterizer/xbox/rasterizer_xbox_hardware_bitmaps.c` | `&(T *)x` is now `(T **)&x`. |
| `hs/hs.c` | Local prototypes that did not agree with `ai_script.h` are removed. |
| `units/vehicles.c` | The local prototype of `unit_update_animation` uses the type of `units.h`. |

`math/real_math.h` had a copy of `plane2d_from_points` that did not agree
with the function in `effects/decals.c`. clang used the copy, and parts of
levels were not visible. The copy now agrees with the function.

Other changes:

| File | Change |
| --- | --- |
| `scenario/scenario.c` | The BSP connection tables have names, not MSVC offsets. |
| `rasterizer/xbox/rasterizer_xbox_environment_fog.c` | A local pointer gets its value from the file-scope array with the same name. |
| `game/player_control.c` | The mouse aims the player on controller 1 directly. |
| `sound/game_sound.c` | The game calculates the obstruction of each sound one time for each tick, not for each frame. |
| `cseries/errors.c` | `debug.txt` stays open between lines. |
| `networking/`, `game/`, `interface/`, `bungie_net/network/` and the pools of objects, effects and sounds | The system link limits and the memory for them. |
| `game/`, `objects/`, `units/`, `networking/` | The distributed netcode. Refer to `NETCODE.md`. |
| `cache/cache_files.c` | When a map's tags load and unload, the port finds the bitmaps that the high-res HUD replaces (`game/hud_hires_tags.c`), and adds the tags of the menus to the menus' map (`game/menu_tags.c`). |
| `interface/ui_widget.c`, `interface/ui_widget_event_handler_functions.c`, `interface/ui_widget_game_data_input_functions.c` | The main menu is the PC version's from `port/assets/menus` (`display.menus`); the menus' widgets can call the port's functions (`game/menu_functions.c`) and send the PC version's custom activation event; the widgets' memory is 256 KB, not 16 KB; the main menu and Multiplayer clear co-op's controllers, so that a gamepad going back to controller 1 is not a controller unplugged; the lobby's split screen players leave alone, and one who quits in game is not joined to the next game (`interface/player_ui.c`). |
| `input/input_abstraction.c`, `game/player_control.c`, `game/players.c`, `game/player_queues_new.c`, `units/units.h` | The keyboard and mouse's actions (`src/xinput_sdl.c`, `include/halo_keyboard.h`) join controller 1's game controls; their reload key reloads on its own, and their action key only acts (a control flag of the port's, sent with the player's action, stops the reload the controller's X falls back to). |
| `sound/sound_manager.c`, `interface/hud.c`, `game/game_engine.c` | The music's and the other sounds' volumes; the HUD's and the scoreboard's settings are read again when Settings changes them. |
| `game/callouts.c`, `game/game_engine.c` | CALLOUTS (`game.callouts`): from game time and the item timers' spawns (`game/item_timers.c`), the callouts planned 30 s ahead from the clips' lengths (the items' calls first, by CALLOUT DETAIL, the clock's fitted around them) and said one at a time through `src/callout_voice.c`. |
| `game/spawn_heat.c`, `game/game_engine.c`, `game/players.c`, `render/render_spawn_markers.c` | SPAWN HEAT (`display.spawn_heat`): every 6 ticks, for each view's player (or an enemy), each spawn's rating by `game_engine_get_starting_location_rating_ex` (the stock rules, one copy: the stock functions call the `_ex` ones with no unit left out and no reason, bit for bit as before, `tools/spawn_heat_check.c`), why it rates 0, and its chance of being picked (`spawn_heat_probabilities`, exact, not sampled); the markers' colours and crosses; a flash at a real spawn from `player_spawn` (host, local) or `network_player_attach_unit` (a client: the spawn under the new unit). |
| `rasterizer/xbox/rasterizer_xbox_shadows.c` | With larger shadow maps (`display.shadow_resolution`), the blur's taps stay half a texel apart, and more passes widen it to cover the same part of the map as on the Xbox. |
| `render/render.c` | The 3D view of each window is antialiased before the HUD is drawn (`display.anti_aliasing`). |
| `interface/hud.c` | In multiplayer, players' names are drawn above their heads (`display.player_names`, `display.player_name_scale`). |
| `interface/interface.c`, `interface/hud_draw.c`, `interface/hud_unit.c`, `interface/hud_weapon.c`, `interface/hud_messaging.c`, `game/game_engine.c` | The HUD's pass of each view clips the view's window to the HUD area, a part of the screen (`display.hud_area`, `hud_area_begin`), and the nav points' off-screen arrows keep to it (`interface/hud_nav_points.c`); the HUD's split-screen choices go through `hud_split_screen_layout` (`display.compact_hud`); the scoreboard fades in `display.scoreboard_fade`'s time. |
| `rasterizer/rasterizer_text.c`, `text/draw_string.c` | Text is drawn from an atlas of the fonts' glyphs, rasterized at the resolution the game draws at (`src/text_hires.c`), when the font has every character of the string. Text can be drawn scaled about a point (`rasterizer_text_set_scale`), as the players' names are. Each glyph's advance is centred on the font tag character's, so the layout is the same, and a glyph is cut at a text box only where the font tag's character visibly was. |

The x86 inline assembly of the game is replaced by C. Thus the compiler
can optimize that code for each processor:

| File | Assembly | Replacement |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `cseries/cseries.h` | x87 `fistp` (`fast_ftol`) | `__builtin_rint` |
| `bitmaps/bitmaps_inlines.h` | x87 conversions | C conversions |
| `math/matrix_math.c` | SSE `matrix4x3_multiply` | a C loop |
| `effects/decals.c` | an x87 conversion | a C conversion |
| `cseries/profile.c` | `rdtsc` | `QueryPerformanceCounter` |
| `cseries/cseries.c` | naked `stristr` | a C `stristr` |
| `cseries/stack_walk_windows.c` | a read of EBP | `__builtin_frame_address` |
| `interface/hud_draw.c` | a read of `[ebp+4]` | `__builtin_return_address(1)` |
| `bink/bink_playback.c` | `int 3` | `__builtin_trap` |

The x87 control and status words (`_control87`, `_statusfp`, `_clearfp` in
`src/msvc_crt.c`) use `fenv.h`. On Android, they use the FPCR and FPSR.
