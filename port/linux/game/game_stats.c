/*
GAME_STATS.C

The game list's statistics recorder (configure.py --game-browser,
HALO_GAME_BROWSER; port/linux/src/browser.c). It watches the game and
changes nothing in it, on the host and on every client alike:

- Every kill as this machine's game has it (game_engine_player_killed:
  who killed whom, betrayal or not), with the damage that dealt it
  (damage.c, where the kill is counted). From these it works out each
  player's multikills (kills each within 4 seconds of the last, the game's
  own window: game_statistics_record_kill), sprees (kills without dying),
  kills by weapon (the damage's tag) and the medals they make.
- Every frame, each player's statistics as they stand, so that a player who
  leaves before the end is still in the report (with what they had when
  they left), and when each player was first and last in the game.

On the host every kill is the host's own, so all of this is exact. A client
is sent the host's statistics and scores (network_distributed.c), which it
reports as they are; it sees each death when its copy of the player dies,
with the host's killer, and usually the host's killing blow (network_damage.c
replays it), so its multikills, sprees and weapons are worked out from what
it saw: a player's are sent only when the kills this machine saw add up to
the host's count of that player's kills, and the report says how each part
was known ("sources").

The host's report goes with the game's listing (game_engine_report_game). A
client that joined through an invite sends its own report a few seconds
after the game ends (browser_client_report), whoever hosted it, so that a
game whose host does not report is recorded too.

Called each frame from the main loop (main.c).
