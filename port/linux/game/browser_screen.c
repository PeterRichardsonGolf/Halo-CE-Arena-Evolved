/*
BROWSER_SCREEN.C

The in-game server browser (configure.py
--game-browser): every game on the game list (port/linux/src/browser.c),
on a screen of its own over the menus, as the game's virtual keyboard is
(interface/virtual_keyboard.c): drawn and driven by code, not a widget of
the user interface's tags.

The Multiplayer menu's ONLINE GAMES item opens it (ui_widget.c). Up and
down pick a game, left and right turn the page, A joins it through its
invite, as a web page's Join or an invite link would, and B goes back. Once
the invite's host answers and advertises its game through the tunnel, the
game is joined and its lobby opened (wait_for_host).

A game on a Custom Edition map (Halo PC's, announced as <file>@ce) or a
HaloMD map (announced as <file>@md: halo_map_families.h) is named as the
menus' map list names it (ui_map_list.c: Halo PC's own names, HaloMD's mod
list's, or the file's made readable), marked HALO PC or HALOMD as the game
list's web pages mark it, and pictured by Halo PC's own picture of it. It is
joined only with the map in its family's folders (and on a build with Halo
PC map support, HALO_CUSTOM_EDITION): else its details say what is missing,
and A says so rather than join.

Start opens the player's profile page in the web browser; RB opens Link
Profile over the list, for where no web browser opens: a code (and a QR
code) to type at the game list's /connect page on another device, then the
profile it was typed for, to confirm with A or refuse with B (browser.c).

The menus' pointer (the mouse, or the touchscreen's taps and drags:
halo_ui_pointer.h) works it as the PC menus' lists: a click on a game picks
it and a click on the picked game joins it, the wheel or a drag steps
through the games, a click on a button's prompt presses that button, and
the right button is B.
