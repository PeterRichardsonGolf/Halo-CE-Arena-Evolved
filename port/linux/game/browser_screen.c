/*
BROWSER_SCREEN.C

The in-game server browser (configure.py
--game-browser): every game on the game list (port/linux/src/browser.c),
on a screen of its own over the menus, as the game's virtual keyboard is
(interface/virtual_keyboard.c): drawn and driven by code, not a widget of
the user interface's tags.

X on the System Link screen opens it (ui_widget.c; the list screen marks
when it is up, ui_widget_game_data_input_functions.c). Up and down pick a
game, left and right turn the page, A joins it through its invite, as a web
page's Join or an invite link would, and B goes back. Once the invite's host
answers, its game shows in the System Link list through the tunnel, to be
picked there as any.

A game on a Custom Edition map (Halo PC's, announced as <file>@ce) or a
HaloMD map (announced as <file>@md: halo_map_families.h) is named as the
menus' map list names it (ui_map_list.c: Halo PC's own names, HaloMD's mod
list's, or the file's made readable), marked HALO PC or HALOMD as the game
list's web pages mark it, and pictured by Halo PC's own picture of it. It is
joined only with the map in its family's folders (and on a build with Halo
PC map support, HALO_CUSTOM_EDITION): else its details say what is missing,
and A says so rather than join.

Start opens the player's profile page in the web browser; RB opens Quick
Connect over the list, for where no web browser opens: a code (and a QR
code) to type at the game list's /connect page on another device, then the
profile it was typed for, to confirm with A or refuse with B (browser.c).
