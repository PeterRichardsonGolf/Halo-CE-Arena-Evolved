/*
PORT_CONFIG.C

The native ports' settings (port_config.h), parsed with tomlc17
(port/third_party/tomlc17). Every setting is in the table below with its
type, default, the HALO_* environment variable that overrides it and the
comment written into a new file. The file is read once, on the first
question; unknown keys and values of the wrong type are reported in the log
and the defaults used instead. A new file has every setting commented out at
its default, so that a later version's default reaches it; a setting is
written as a value only when the player chooses one (config_write). Once
the file exists only those lines, the settings a newer version adds and an
older file's layout (config_version) are changed in it, so that the player's
edits and comments stay.
