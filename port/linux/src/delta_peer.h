/*
DELTA_PEER.H

Delta Peer (docs/delta.md): ChupathingyCE's own messages between the
machines of one game, beside OpenCE's game protocol, which stays as it is.

- A host that speaks it listens on DELTA_PEER_PORT (the game's port + 10)
  and sets DELTA_ADVERTISED_FLAG in its advertisement.
- A client that joined such a host (the game's join, unchanged) sends HELLO;
  the host answers WELCOME, or LEGACY for another major. No answer within
  DELTA_PEER_HANDSHAKE_TIME means legacy only: the game never waits.
- Each pair uses the capabilities both have; the host sends every Delta
  client a ROSTER of every machine's claims (its platform key, its profile)
  and of what the whole room shares.
- Either side with a newer signed legacy table than the other's sends it
  (TABLE, in pieces; TABLE_HAVE says what each has): delta.c checks it.

Its sockets are the game's own Winsock layer's (xnet.c), so network.address
and the invite tunnel (p2p.c) carry them as they do the game's: no new path.

Two layers here: the sessions (struct delta_peer, delta_peer.c: no sockets,
no platform; the tests drive it directly) and the game's (delta_peer_game.c:
one session over real sockets, called from the shared source's hooks).
Nothing is trusted: a peer's claims are shown as claims and never decide
game state; its limits only make a host take fewer players.
