PLATFORM.H

Shared internals of the Linux platform layer, which implements the Xbox SDK
(XAPI, Direct3D 8, DirectSound, XNet, ...) and MSVC runtime interfaces that
the game calls. Files including this header are compiled with the game's
ABI and see the XDK declarations, so every definition is type-checked
against the SDK prototype it replaces.
