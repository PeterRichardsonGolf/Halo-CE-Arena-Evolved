HALO_UI_MAP_LIST.H

The menus' list of multiplayer maps on the native builds
(port/linux/game/ui_map_list.c): the Xbox's thirteen, as they were, then the
Xbox v5 community maps (custom_maps.c), then the Custom Edition maps,
named with [CE], with Halo PC's names, descriptions and
pictures of them, then HaloMD's maps, named with [MD] (halo_map_families.h). The multiplayer map list, its rows and the
lobby (source/interface) ask it in place of the game's fixed thirteen.
