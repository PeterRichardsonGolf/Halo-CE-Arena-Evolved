/*
DELTA.H

Delta, ChupathingyCE's network family (docs/delta.md): what our machines say
to each other and to our services beyond the game protocol OpenCE defines,
which stays OpenCE's byte for byte. This header holds Delta Peer's numbers
(its major, its advertisement flag, the capability registry), the legacy
number's compatibility table, this build's wire, and the signed legacy
table's calls (port/linux/src/delta.c).

The compatibility table documents the legacy numbers and checks
halo_port_limits.h against them (tools/test_delta.py). Delta Peer's wire
format is port/linux/src/delta_wire.h; its sessions are delta_peer.c.

Plain C89 (no // comments, no stdint.h): Warthog (the Xbox build, MSVC 7.1)
reads this header too.

after a cross-play test of that wire; a build reads its own wire's row alone.

ID is never sent; the game protocol is chupa-20a's, with OpenCE build-141's
additive version 21 joined too: its hosts announce 20, not the table's
newest, so that ChupathingyCE 0.7.0b, of 20, joins them) */
