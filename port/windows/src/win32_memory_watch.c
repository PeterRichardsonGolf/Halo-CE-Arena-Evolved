/*
WIN32_MEMORY_WATCH.C

Write tracking for guest memory that the renderer caches: the Windows version
of port/linux/src/memory_watch.c (see there for the design). The pages behind
a cached texture are made read-only; a vectored exception handler catches
the first write, records a new generation for the page and makes it
writable again.

In the 64-bit build (HALO_64BIT) the window is in the Xbox address space
(source/cseries/xbox_address.h): pages are named by Xbox address, as in
the 32-bit build, and host pointers are converted at the edges.
