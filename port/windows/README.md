# Windows

`ninja windows` compiles the game with clang for 32-bit x86 Windows. The
result is a native executable, `build/windows/halo.exe`, with `SDL3.dll`
next to it. You must build on Windows.

The Windows build uses the platform layer of the Linux build
(`port/linux/src`). The graphics, the sound, the input, the settings and
the multiplayer functions are the same as on Linux. Refer to
[port/linux/README.md](../linux/README.md).

## Requirements

You do not need the Xbox SDK.

- Visual Studio or the Visual Studio Build Tools, with the C++ workload.
  The build uses the 32-bit (x86) MSVC libraries and a Windows 10 or 11
  SDK. It does not use the MSVC compiler.
- LLVM (clang and lld), Python 3 and ninja in the `PATH`. For example,
  enter `scoop install llvm python ninja`.
- A network connection for the first build. `configure.py` downloads the
  Visual C++ development package of SDL 3.4.16 to
  `build/windows/third_party`.

## Build the game

1. Go to the root folder of the repository.
2. Enter `python configure.py`.
3. Enter `ninja windows`.

`configure.py` generates the Windows build only on Windows.

The build uses all the instructions of the processor of the computer that
builds it (`-march=native`). Such a build does not always start on a
different computer. To make a build for other computers, enter
`python configure.py --portable`. Refer to the build options in the main
[README](../../README.md#build-options).

For a new optimization profile (`--pgo=train`), the build compiles the
profile runtime of LLVM for 32-bit x86 (`pgo/halo_profile_runtime.c`).
LLVM for Windows supplies this runtime only for x86-64.

### 64-bit

`ninja windows64` builds the same game as native x64 code,
`build/windows64/halo.exe`, with `SDL3.dll` for x64 next to it. It needs the
x64 MSVC libraries of Visual Studio instead of the x86 ones.

It is the 64-bit build of the other systems (`HALO_64BIT`: see
[port/macos/README.md](../macos/README.md)), with these differences:

- Windows keeps `long` 32 bits wide on x64, as the Xbox compiler did. The
  game sources need none of the `long` rewrite of the Linux and macOS
  64-bit builds (`tools/lp64_rewrite.py`).
- The platform layer reserves the 4 GB Xbox address space at 1 TB with
  `VirtualAlloc`, through the `mmap` of `src/win32_posix.c`. The game stops
  if it cannot get that address. The executable does not use high-entropy
  address randomization, which could put the first allocations of the
  process in that range.
- The write tracking and the crash reports of `src/win32_memory_watch.c`
  convert between Xbox addresses and the pointers of the process. A crash
  report gives the address of `halo.exe` in that run, and the calls come
  from the unwind data of x64 code, not from a chain of frame pointers.
- It is not optimized with a profile. The committed profiles are those of
  the 32-bit builds.

It plays the Custom Edition maps of Halo PC (`maps/ce/`) and HaloMD's maps
(`md_maps/`), it plays with the
32-bit builds and the other ports over the network, and it is a dedicated
server too (`server/README.md`). Its releases are a separate download,
`arena-evolved-windows64-release.zip`.

## Start the game

Enter `build\windows\halo.exe`.

The game finds the game data as on Linux. Refer to "Start the game" in
[port/linux/README.md](../linux/README.md#start-the-game).

| Item | Location |
| --- | --- |
| Settings | `config.toml` next to `halo.exe` |
| Saved games | `%APPDATA%\halo`, or `paths.saves` in `config.toml` |
| Log | `debug.txt` in the data root (the folder that contains `maps\`) |
| Log of the port | The console. The release build has no console: `halo.log` next to `halo.exe` |

## How the port operates

The game is 32-bit code, as on Linux, because its data contains 32-bit
pointers (the 64-bit build keeps that data in a 4 GB Xbox address space:
see "64-bit" above). The clang target `i686-pc-windows-msvc` gives the ABI of MSVC:
the structure layout, the 16-bit `wchar_t` and the calling conventions.
Thus the Windows build needs fewer changes than the Linux build.

The executable is large-address-aware, because the platform layer reserves
the Xbox memory at `0x80000000`.

### Headers

- The game and the platform layer use the Xbox SDK declarations of
  `port/include/xdk`, not the Windows SDK declarations with the same names.
  The compiler reads `port/include/xdk` before the Windows SDK.
- The C runtime is the static UCRT of Windows.
- `include/halo_windows_prefix.h` is the first header of each file. It gives
  Windows names to the Xbox SDK functions of the platform layer (for example
  `CreateFileA`, `ReadFile`, `Sleep`). Thus the code for Windows gets to
  Windows. The list of names is in `include/halo_windows_api_names.h`.
- `include/crt` changes some C runtime headers. The file functions of the
  game (`fopen`, `open`, `mkdir`) go through the translation of Xbox paths
  (`src/windows_crt.c`).
- `include/posix` declares the POSIX functions that the platform layer uses.

### Code for Windows

These files use only the Windows SDK:

| File | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| `src/win32_files.c`, `src/win32_net.c` | The file and socket functions of `port/linux/src/posix.h`. |
| `src/win32_posix.c` | The POSIX functions on Windows threads, critical sections, condition variables, `VirtualAlloc` and the performance counter. |
| `src/win32_memory_watch.c` | The write tracking of textures, with a vectored exception handler. It also writes reports of crashes. |

`port.json` gives the Linux files that these files replace, and the Windows
libraries of the link.

### Inline functions

MSVC makes a COMDAT copy of an external `__inline` function where it does
not inline a call. Some files call such functions through a prototype.
clang inlines more calls. Thus a function can have no copy. The build
prevents this:

- `port/linux/game/msvc_comdat.c` gives one weak definition of each header
  inline function.
- A wrapper takes the address of each `__inline` function in a `.c` file.
  Thus the compiler makes an external copy (`inline_export_wrapper` in
  `tools/windows_build.py`).

MSVC gives file scope to a structure tag in a prototype. clang does not.
Thus the build also includes the declarations of the Linux build
(`build/windows/halo_msvc_tags.h`).

## Limits

- Bink video is not available. The game skips the movies.
- The game uses only the ANSI file functions. A path to the data or the
  saved games with characters that are not in the code page of the system
  does not always operate.
