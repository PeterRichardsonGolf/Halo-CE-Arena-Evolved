"""Builds one native port in one configuration, as the GitHub workflow does
(.github/workflows/build.yml), and collects what it built into dist/:

    python tools/ci_build.py linux debug
    python tools/ci_build.py android release
    python tools/ci_build.py server-x64 release --alpine
    python tools/ci_build.py linux profile

Builds are portable (any x86-64 processor; for the arm64 server, any
64-bit ARM), so they run on other computers. Debug builds skip link-time and profile-guided optimisation,
which only make the build slower; release builds use both, as a local
release build does (profile-guided optimisation needs clang 22 or later,
and is skipped with an older one). A profile build is a debug build with
configure.py --profile, so that the profiling build is built too.
CI_COMPILER_LAUNCHER (ccache, say) is passed on as --compiler-launcher.

The version comes from the environment (tools/version.py), which a
release workflow sets: HALO_VERSION (0.1.0-beta, or
0.1.0-beta-nightly.42), and HALO_RELEASE_BUILD=1 for a release (whose
version must be VERSION's). Without them, a build is VERSION's -dev. No
Arena Evolved build looks for updates, a release's included (the updater
is off: port/linux/src/updater.c).

The Android app is signed with a release key when
port/android/keystore.properties is there (a release workflow writes it;
port/android/README.md): arena-evolved-android-<config>.apk. Without it
(pull requests, forks), the debug build has the runner's own key,
arena-evolved-android-debug-testkey.apk, which installs over nothing
signed with another key, and the release build is unsigned,
arena-evolved-android-release-unsigned.apk. A profile build's app is the
debug variant's.

The dedicated server (server-x86, server-x64, server-arm64:
tools/server_build.py) is built against musl, so that it is one static
program: on a musl system (Alpine Linux) as it is, or with --alpine in
Alpine's Docker container of the server's architecture (an x86 one runs on
an x86-64 machine, an arm64 one on an arm64 machine); it goes into
dist/chupathingyce-server-linux-<arch> (-debug for a debug build), with
its README and playlists. A release's server there is stripped of its debug
information; a debug build's keeps it.
