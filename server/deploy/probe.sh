# The game list's probe on the dedicated server's host (server/docs/docker.md,
# "The game list's probe"): the game that an invite leads to, read by the game
# (HALO_PROBE) in a container of its own, which goes when it is done:
#   probe.sh <invite>
# prints the game's "probe: {...}" line. Runs as root (sudo, from
# probe-ssh.sh); the invite must be one, its hexadecimal digits only. The
# container's data folder is in memory (the saves in it: the game's scratch
# drive wants about 33 MB), and goes with it; writable by anyone (mode
# 1777), since the probe isn't root: a folder it can't write stalls it.
